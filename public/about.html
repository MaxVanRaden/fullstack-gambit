        <h1>What is Fullstack Gambit?</h1>
        <p>This is Max Van Raden and Micah Blasko's final project for CS465 at Portland State University. Our goal was to make the game chess
            with socket.io so that multiple players could connect from different browsers and play eachother. We used an Express Server and 
            socket.io to handle the server connections between clients as well as Heroku to manage the webpage.

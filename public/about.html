        <h1>What is Fullstack Gambit?</h1>
        <p>The Fullstack Gambit is Max Van Raden and Micah Blasko's final project for CS465 at Portland State University. Our goal was to make the game chess
            with socket.io so that multiple players could connect from different browsers and play each other. We used an Express Server and 
            socket.io to handle the server connections between clients as well as Heroku to manage the webpage. The implementation of chess itself is completely from
            scratch, and is written in JavaScript.

        <h1>How to Start a Game</h1>
        <p>Our website is pretty simple, and getting a game setup is easy. 
            <br><br>Step 1: Both players hit the "Join Game" button. Whichever player hits it first will play as white.  
            <br>Step 2: both players hit the "Ready" button.
            <br><br>That's it! At this point, both the "Connected" and "Ready" lights should be green for both players. The game has now started. When it is your turn, click on the piece you want to move, and then click on the square you
           want to move it to. If you want to give up and start the game over, click the "Resign" button on your turn before making a move.
